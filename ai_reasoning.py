"""
AI Reasoning Layer — Claude-powered trade filter
=================================================
Sits between signal scoring and order placement.
Called only when score >= threshold (signal already passed 7-check system).

What it does:
  - Reads recent candle direction, momentum, losses today, price zone history
  - Reasons like a senior trader: "does this trade make sense RIGHT NOW?"
  - Returns: decision (YES/NO/REDUCE), confidence (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), reason, lot_multiplier
  - On HIGH confidence: increases lot size (up to 3x)
  - On LOW confidence: blocks the trade entirely
  - Knows you are a day trader expecting 5-8 trades per day — will not over-block

Lot sizing tiers:
  HIGH   confidence + score 7/7 = 3x units
  HIGH   confidence + score 6/7 = 2x units
  MEDIUM confidence             = 1x units (normal)
  LOW    confidence             = BLOCK trade

DECISION RULES — apply in order, first match wins:
1. Chase block: entry is >300p away from last exit in same direction → NO
2. Zone trap: same direction as last loss AND price within 150p of SL exit → NO, always
3. Loss filter: losses today >= 2 AND score < 6 → NO | score 6/7 → YES (2 trades max) | score 7/7 → YES (3 trades, high win chance)
4. Asian filter: is_asian=True AND score < 5 → NO
5. H4 conflict: H4 trend opposes direction → NO (H4 is the macro filter, non-negotiable)
6. H1 momentum: recent candles show 3+ consecutive moves AGAINST signal direction → LOW confidence
7. Session quality: London Open or NY Overlap → allow MEDIUM+ | Asian → allow MEDIUM+ | Off-hours → require HIGH
8. Strong setup: H4 aligned + score 6-7 + H1 candles agree + good session → HIGH confidence

CONFIDENCE → LOT SIZE:
- HIGH + score 7 → lot_multiplier 3 (3 trades worth of size — highest win probability)
- HIGH + score 6 → lot_multiplier 2 (2 trades worth of size)
- MEDIUM → lot_multiplier 1
- LOW → decision must be NO
